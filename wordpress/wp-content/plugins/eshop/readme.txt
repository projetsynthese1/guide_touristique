== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Yet Another Related Posts Plugin =
If you are using this plugin I recommend you disable it before upgrading or deactivating/reactivating eShop, as it may be the cause of some incompatibility issues.


= Does this work with Wordpress MultiSite =

Yes - but do not activate the plugin via the network activate link. eShop needs to run the activation process for each and every site within your network. This is currently not done when you activate a plugin for the entire network. Enable the plugin for the sites to activate themselves instead.

= I updated and now things don't look right = 

There is always a possibility that necessary CSS changes have been made, always remember to check the _Appearance > eShop_ page where you will be notified if they do not match, and be given an opportunity to view the differences.

= Is eShop translatable =

Yes! the po file is available from Quirm.net [eshop.po download](http://quirm.net/download/26/)

= Support =

Available via the WordPress forums (please tag the post eshop) or via [Quirm.net forums](http://quirm.net/forum/forum.php?id=14)

Due to increasing demands we no longer offer free CSS support.
